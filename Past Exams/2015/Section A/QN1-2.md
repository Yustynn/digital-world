# QN1
## i
`b` references the same list instance as `a`.

i.e. other than reassigning either `a` or `b`, any change (mutation) to `a` or `b` will affect the other variable's value as well.

## ii
`c` becomes a shallow copy of `a`. Meaning changing any of `c`'s or `a`'s' elements other than their shared 2nd element (index 2) does not affect the other variable. Mutating element 2 affects the other variable, however.

## iii
`d` is a deep copy of `a`. Mutating `a`/`d` does nothing to `d`/`a`

# QN2
Obstacles are only checked for *once* (`line 7`) and those values are stored, then subsequently checked against at every iteration of the while loop.
This **doesn't work** - you should have a new check for obstacles on every iteration of the while loop. Currently, only one of two things will happen.

## Scenario 1 -  no obstacles initially
Robot forever moves forward (the saved obstacle check will always show no obstacles). The while loop will never exit.

## Scenario 2 - obstructed initially
The robot will stutter forward for an instant (`line 6`) and then stop as the while loop condition immediately fails.

Also, logically, if you're not gonna use sleep then why import it?
