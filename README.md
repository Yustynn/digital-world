# What is this?
There's a course in the Singapore University of Technology and Design called
**Digital World**. It endeavours to teach all students of my school basic
programming. I'm taking it, and these are all my efforts in solving its
homework.

# Why is it so weird?
Yeah, I'm going a little over the top in trying to solve the questions in weird
and often just unproductive ways. It's exploration more than anything - I
already know how to program so I'm just taking this opportunity to explore
python and its ecosystem.
