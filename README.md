# What is this?
There's a course in the Singapore University of Technology and Design called
**Digital World**. It endeavours to teach all students of my school basic
programming. I'm taking it, and these are all my efforts in solving its
homework.

# Why is it so weird?
Yeah, I'm going a little over the top in trying to solve the questions in weird
and often just unproductive ways. It's exploration more than anything - I
already know how to program so I'm just taking this opportunity to explore
python and its ecosystem.

# Who is this for?
Me. It's an exercise in developing language and ecosystem knowledge, and good practices. I'm often gonna be verbose in these readmes. They're for me to reflect and think. But if you feel like reading, by all means.
